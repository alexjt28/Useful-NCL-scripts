# Useful-NCL-scripts

The files in this repository are user-ready scripts that are compatible with netCDF climate data output.
A short description of each is as follows:

netcdf_mapplot_avg_incl_diff_winds_statsig.ncl: A complicated script that is optimized for functionality.
mapplot_avg_diff_simple_3cases.ncl: A simplified version of the above script that is set up to run with three cases.
